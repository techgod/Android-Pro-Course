# Week 3 Assignment

So this week you're assignment is to add Java side functionality to your app. You can continue with the same project you did in week 2 as you already have the layout ready. (Though you're free to create a new project too if you please)

Your task is the following:
1) capture the input of the user in your first activity. This can be through an edittext, radio button, check box, switch, spinner, rating bar etc. *Make sure to capture atleast two unique inputs* e.g. in the below example I capture the input from the RatingBar, EditText and RadioButton.
2) next, have a button to submit the input, which onclick starts another activity.
3) in the new activity, display the response you had captured

For submitting:
Take screenshots of:
1) your first activity before entering information
2) your first activity after entering information
3) the second activity with the responses

Example:
