#### You've made it! The 4th & final week of our course. You've done some amazing stuff in the last 3 weeks! You have all the ingredients to make a complete app. But now let's talk about stuff which adds that extra flavouring to your app!

That can be added using APIs. API stands for Application Programming Interface. A 
good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.

First lets have a look at using Google APIs. More specifically, you lets check out the Maps SDK for Android - API
We have already seen an implementation of this in our GD. Here's a full walkthrough to add a map to your app:

Firebase Overview:
Instead of learning the coding aspect of Firebase, the idea here is to show you about the existence of Firebase & other such tools to make your life easier! Just have a look!<br>
