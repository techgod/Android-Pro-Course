## Week 4 Assignment

Your week 4 assignment is based on using Google APIs - more specifically you'll be making use of the Google Maps for Android API.<br>

**Instructions:**
- Create a new project. It should just be an empty activity.
- Now add a map to this activity using SupportMapFragment view.
- Place a marker at your home location. 
- BONUS: Draw a circle around your map (of any radius).

Hint: Don't forget to check out the *code* folder - that project contains the code to create a map & add a marker. TODOs are marked where you can do the required changes.

Submit just one screenshot of your final result, something like this:
